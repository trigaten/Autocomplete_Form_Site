A very simple full-stack data collection program that gives users autocomplete suggestions from Wikipedia.

Data is entered then submitted by user (Frontend)

Ajax calls saveData.php which creates a new textfile and writes json data to it (Backend)

Easily modifiable to save data to SQL database or send to external server.
Questions/items asked are also easily modifiable.

If you don't have a server that can easily run PHP, run this using the program MAMP: https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp
