A very simple full-stack data collection program.

Data is entered then submitted by user. (Frontend)

Ajax calls saveData.php which creates a new textfile and writes the data to it (Backend)

If you don't have a server that can easily run PHP, test this using the program MAMP: https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp
